R2D3 is the nasty but unstoppable cousin of R2D3
The project was initially developped by the KBG after russian officals realised in the late 70s they needed a strong asnwer to the American space program.
But after only a few months, the protype escaped and was fortunately retrieved by WTF Robotics, who was taking care of the R2D3 ever since.
